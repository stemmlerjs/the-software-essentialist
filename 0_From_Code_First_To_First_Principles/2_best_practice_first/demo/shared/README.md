## `acceptance`

> Shared acceptance tests

Acceptance tests are specifications written from the perspective of the User using the system. They're written in such a manner that allows them to be executed on either the `frontend` or the `backend`. 

Acceptance tests _should_ be executed on both the `frontend` and the `backend` alike.

# Tic Tac Toe

The goal of this exercise is to refactor with a specific focus on two techniques to help you refine your understanding of the Stereotypical Architecture and how to decompose layers using the 54321 System.

The game has already been written and works.

You can run the tests. It is up to you to refactor the code using:

1. Object Calisthenics Rules 
2. The Stereotypical Architecture 

You are complete this exercise once you've:

- refactored using the rules
- labelled each of your abstractions

# 3. Manage Complexity (TPP)

> This one is all about learning how to keep your solutions as simple as possible.

> Here, the focus is to learn how to avoid transformations that clutter the design and make it harder for you to progress. 

> It's easy for you to carve yourself into an "impasse" when you choose more complex transformations. 

> If you choose simpler transformations, it becomes less likely you'll get stuck.

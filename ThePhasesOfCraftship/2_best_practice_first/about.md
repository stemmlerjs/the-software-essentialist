> how do we give folks starting context for their assignments; will we start with some template code so that they don't have to do a ton of various building and scripting tasks?

- Given there's one final submission for best practice-first...
- Daniel: present a solution that removes us from 


> how to organize the folders here?

> how should we structure code-first here?

> should we get folks to use Docker?

No. Lets avoid docker. We'll use a cloud service.

> how do we get the most basic deployment pipeline?

- deploy to netlify/render

- will we organize this into exercises & assignments for each section (ie: in responsibility-first, there are some exercises, and it looks like we're going to have a single final submission for each)
- what the about the option where folks can just make their own repo and do their work on that?
- will folks be updating their repo over time? does this mean we're going to be using the same project the entire time or will we also use other ones?
- will this be organized or will it feel a bit unstructured and confusing if we don't work against one repo?
- how will folks handle their deployment tasks?
- how will we review projects? what's the review structure like? how can I be certain that the students assignments' will be reviewed? (staffing/feedback/self-feedback/volunteering); how can we avoid non-reviewed assignments in the community? 


> Goals/capabilities

- Students can easily find their course work to do (exercises)
- Students can see a finished assignment for each of the phases of craftship
- Students have a starting point in which to kick off their work from
- Students have clarity and a simple way for them to submit both their exercises and their assignments for each of the phases of craftship, which we have decided will have exactly one submission.

## Exercises

- Exercises can be completed by folking the course repo and submitting that.
- These can be done any number of times.

## Assignments

- Students can see the recommended starting point for their assignments via the "starter" folder for a phase of craftship
- Students can also see a solution folder for the assignment

## Working on & submitting an assignment

- Students work on their assignments in their own repos 
- Students can optionally refer to the starter folder to get a sense of where to start
- Students can also look at the solution folder to compare their end work

## starter folder

- this exists solely to help students kick off their work from a place where they can just focus on what is in focus for this assignment; circumvents common setup problems
- daniel: there is a starter folder for each of the phases

  > for example, pattern-first

## reviewing assignments (self review)

- Students can self review their assignments by looking at how it was done in the solution folder

## reviewing 

> Acceptance Criteria

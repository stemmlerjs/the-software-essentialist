 * ðŸ”˜ I have committed on every single transition from red to green to refactor

3 returns "Fizz"
5 returns "Buzz
15 returns "FizzBuzz"
9 returns "Fizz"
43 returns "43"
42 returns "Fizz"
45 returns "FizzBuzz"

-12 (you decide, throw an Error or handle some other way)
any non-number (you decide, throw an Error or handle some other way)
ðŸ”˜ Once I have made the aforementioned tests pass, I have refactored my test specifications to use it.each() to perform parameterization (see Tip #3 here)
ðŸ”˜ There is no duplication in my test code or my production code
